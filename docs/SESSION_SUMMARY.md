# Session Summary - October 11, 2025

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Strategic Decision âœ…

**Adopted a pragmatic approach to DRM backend development:**

- Analyzed that Nuthatch's value is in unique UX features, not DRM plumbing
- Decided to strategically adopt Anvil's proven DRM code (MIT licensed)
- Focus our creativity on: window behaviors, blur effects, React integration
- Use Anvil as reference for: session management, GPU init, buffer allocation

### 2. Documentation Created âœ…

**Comprehensive planning and tracking:**

- `PLAN_OF_RECORD.md` - Three-phase execution strategy
- `DRM_REWRITE.md` - Progress tracking and lessons learned
- `TESTING_DRM_MINIMAL.md` - Step-by-step testing guide
- Updated todo list with clear, actionable tasks

### 3. Code Implementation âœ…

**Created minimal DRM test module:**

- `src/drm_minimal.rs` - Validates environment before full implementation
  - Initializes LibSeat session
  - Finds primary GPU
  - Enumerates DRM devices
  - Creates event loop
  - Provides detailed logging of each step

**Updated build system:**

- Added `anyhow` dependency for better error handling
- Commented out old broken DRM code
- Main.rs routes to drm_minimal when --drm flag is used
- Compiles cleanly to release binary

### 4. Studied Reference Implementation âœ…

**Deep dive into Anvil's architecture:**

- Read 950 lines of `anvil/src/udev.rs`
- Understanding key patterns:
  - `LibSeatSession` for VT and device access
  - `UdevBackend` for GPU discovery
  - `DrmDevice` + `GbmDevice` for hardware access
  - `GpuManager` with multi-renderer support
  - `DrmCompositor` for scanout and frame timing

## Current State

### What Works âœ…

- Clean project structure with clear separation of concerns
- Minimal test module compiles and is ready to run
- Comprehensive documentation for next steps
- Strategic plan that maximizes productivity

### What's Next ðŸŽ¯

1. **Immediate**: Test drm_minimal in TTY4 (tonight/tomorrow)
2. **This Week**: Implement full DRM backend based on Anvil
3. **Next Week**: Get colored output and cursor rendering working

## Key Insights

### 1. **Pragmatism Wins**

Copying proven DRM initialization code is smart engineering, not laziness.
The value of Nuthatch is in its UX innovations, not in reimplementing kernel APIs.

### 2. **Incremental Validation**

Testing each component (session, GPU, devices) separately before full implementation
reduces debugging complexity by orders of magnitude.

### 3. **Reference Code > Documentation**

Reading Anvil's working implementation was more valuable than struggling with
API docs. Working code shows patterns and edge cases that docs miss.

### 4. **Focus Energy Correctly**

- DRM/Session/EGL setup: **Copy from Anvil** (boring plumbing)
- Window behaviors/Blur/React chrome: **Build custom** (unique value)

## Files Changed

### Created

- `src/drm_minimal.rs` - Minimal DRM environment test
- `docs/PLAN_OF_RECORD.md` - Strategic plan
- `docs/DRM_REWRITE.md` - Progress tracker
- `docs/TESTING_DRM_MINIMAL.md` - Testing guide
- `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified

- `src/main.rs` - Route to drm_minimal for testing
- `src/drm.rs` - Commented out old broken code
- `Cargo.toml` - Added anyhow dependency

## Metrics

- **Lines of new code**: ~100 (drm_minimal.rs)
- **Lines of documentation**: ~400
- **Anvil code studied**: ~950 lines
- **Build time**: 3 seconds (release)
- **Compiler warnings**: 8 (unused imports in old code)
- **Compiler errors**: 0 âœ…

## Next Session Checklist

- [ ] Run drm_minimal test in TTY4
- [ ] Verify all environment checks pass
- [ ] Create src/drm_new.rs with Anvil's initialization
- [ ] Implement device_added() function
- [ ] Test basic DRM device opening

## Confidence Level

**HIGH** - We have:

- Proven reference implementation (Anvil works in our TTY)
- Clear incremental path forward
- Proper validation at each step
- Focus on the right problems

The foundational work is boring but necessary. Once we get rendering working,
we can focus on the creative features that make Nuthatch special.

**Status**: Ready for TTY testing  
**Blocked**: No blockers  
**Risk**: Low - following proven patterns  
**Momentum**: High - clear path forward ðŸš€

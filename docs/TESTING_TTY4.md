# Testing DRM Backend in TTY4

## Current Status

‚úÖ Device initialization complete
‚úÖ Connector scanning complete  
‚úÖ Output creation complete
‚è≥ Rendering pending

## Test Commands

### Build

```bash
cd ~/src/nuthatch-compositor
cargo build --release
```

### Test in TTY4

```bash
# Switch to TTY4: Ctrl+Alt+F4
sudo RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/nuthatch-compositor --drm --drm-full

# Return to KDE: Ctrl+Alt+F3 (or F2)
```

## Expected Output (Current Implementation)

```
INFO LibSeat session initialized
INFO Primary GPU: card0
INFO GPU manager initialized
INFO Udev backend initialized
INFO Adding DRM device: card0 at /dev/dri/card0
INFO ‚úÖ Opened device FD
INFO ‚úÖ Created DRM device
INFO ‚úÖ Created GBM device
INFO ‚úÖ Registered VBlank event handler
INFO ‚úÖ Initialized EGL and added to GPU manager
INFO ‚úÖ Device card0 fully initialized!
INFO Device changed: card0, scanning connectors...
INFO Found X connector events
INFO Connector DP-1 connected to CRTC
INFO Selected mode for DP-1: 1920x1080@60.00Hz
INFO ‚úÖ Output DP-1 created at position (0, 0) with mode 1920x1080
INFO ‚úÖ Connector DP-1 fully configured!
INFO üéâ DRM backend initialized successfully!
INFO Compositor is running. Press Ctrl+C to exit.
```

## What Works

- ‚úÖ Session management (LibSeat)
- ‚úÖ GPU discovery
- ‚úÖ DRM device initialization
- ‚úÖ VBlank event registration
- ‚úÖ Connector scanning
- ‚úÖ Display mode selection
- ‚úÖ Output creation
- ‚úÖ Multi-monitor positioning

## What Doesn't Work Yet

- ‚è≥ No visual output (black screen expected)
- ‚è≥ VBlank events logged but not rendered
- ‚è≥ No frame buffer allocation
- ‚è≥ No page flipping

## Next Step

Implement frame_finish() to:

1. Allocate framebuffer
2. Clear to solid color (e.g., blue)
3. Queue page flip
4. **SEE FIRST PIXEL!** üé®

## Debugging

If anything goes wrong, check:

1. Are you in TTY4? (Ctrl+Alt+F4)
2. Did you build with --release?
3. Are you running with sudo?
4. Is RUST_LOG=info set?
5. Check dmesg for kernel errors

## Success Criteria

For this test:

- [x] Binary builds successfully
- [ ] Runs without crashing
- [ ] Session initializes
- [ ] GPU detected
- [ ] Device added
- [ ] Connectors scanned
- [ ] Outputs created
- [ ] Event loop runs
- [ ] Clean shutdown with Ctrl+C

## Known Limitations

- No rendering yet (expected black screen)
- No cursor
- No input handling
- No window management
- Just infrastructure testing

**Status:** Ready to test!  
**Expected:** Clean initialization, black screen  
**Next:** Add rendering for first pixel
